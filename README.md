# Book Browser

Book Browser is a search app for choosing your next great read. If you're not sure what you are looking for, the app shows the current New York Times best seller lists for fiction and nonfiction. You can also search one of many popular author choices or use the search bar to find a specific book. Choose a book from the list to read more details and find links to a preview of the chosen book or a purchase link to purchase the e-book.
